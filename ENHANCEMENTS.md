# SecureDoc AI Enhancement Summary

## Implemented Features

1. **Enhanced Text Redaction**
   - Added `redact_text_entities` method to replace PII with "[REDACTED_<ENTITY>]" markers
   - Updated `process_document` to handle text redaction alongside image redaction
   - Included redacted text in reports for better traceability

2. **Advanced PDF Redaction**
   - Added `redact_pdf` method using PyPDF2 and pikepdf libraries
   - Implemented graceful fallbacks when libraries aren't available
   - Added structure for direct PDF manipulation (placeholder implementation for core functionality)

3. **Database Integration for Audit Logging**
   - Updated `AuditLogger` to store logs in both files and database
   - Added database session handling to existing logging methods
   - Implemented error handling to ensure logging continues even if DB operations fail

4. **Updated Dependencies**
   - Added PyPDF2 and pikepdf to requirements.txt
   - Uncommented SQLAlchemy, alembic, and psycopg2 dependencies

5. **Added Comprehensive Tests**
   - Created test_redact.py with tests for all redaction methods
   - Added tests for text redaction, image redaction, PDF redaction
   - Included database integration tests with mocking

6. **Updated Documentation**
   - Enhanced README.md with new features and examples
   - Added database setup instructions
   - Added detailed description of redaction capabilities

## Next Steps

1. **Complete PDF Redaction Implementation**
   - Fully implement the text extraction and replacement in PDFs
   - Add proper position mapping between detected entities and PDF coordinates

2. **Database Schema Migrations**
   - Create Alembic migrations for the existing models
   - Add indexes for performance optimization

3. **API Enhancements**
   - Add endpoints to retrieve redacted text directly
   - Add endpoints to query audit logs and PII findings

4. **UI Integration**
   - Create a simple web UI for document upload and redaction
   - Add visualization of redacted areas

5. **Performance Optimization**
   - Add caching for frequently accessed documents
   - Implement batch processing for large documents
